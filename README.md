# Anti-Reflection Coating Designs for Simons Observatory Alumina and Silicon Optics

This repository contains the design files for the metamaterial Anti-Reflection Coatings (ARCs) for the Simons Observatory (SO).

The zipped file contains two directories, one for the alumina ARC designs and one for the silicon ARC designs. 
Within each of those directories are subdirectories for each of the SO observing bands, LF, MF, and UHF.
Inside those directories are the Ansys Electronic Desktop files that contain the HFSS ARC design and model.

These files were designed and run on ANSYS Electromagnetics Suite Release 2020 R1.
